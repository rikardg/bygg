# Other systems

Below is a list of other systems I've found while developing Bygg.

## Python

### https://github.com/Teriks/pake

Bygg is similar to Pake in many ways. I didn't find Pake until Bygg was well
underway, but I have since added the decorator notation after inspiration from
Pake.

### https://scons.org/

SCons has been around for a long time, and is still maintained. From what I can
tell, they seem more to have a goal of encapsulating complexity and providing
easy ways to e.g. build C or Java programs; much more like CMake than being
just a build execution engine.

## Lua

## Make

### https://github.com/Trepan-Debuggers/remake

A fork of GNU Make that adds some nice quality of life features, like
debugging, profiling and task listing.
